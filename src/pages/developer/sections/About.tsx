                        As a landscape architect I am close to design and 3D modeling. This job taught me how to handle
                        multiple tasks and adhere to strict deadlines. But I've always been curious about how
                        feature-rich web apps work. I really like to learn new things and I like graphic design. This
                        curiosity and eagerness resulted in the completion of the junior programmer course - mainly JAVA
                        for start and JS in the project phase (backend & frontend). I would like to continue this
                        journey with my first full-stack developer job with the opportunity to learn the basics of UX.
