                        As a landscape architect I am close to design and 3D modeling. This job taught me how to handle
                        multiple tasks and adhere to strict deadlines. I really like to learn new things and I like
                        graphic design.

                        But I've always been curious about how feature-rich web apps work. This curiosity and eagerness
                        resulted in the completion of the junior programmer course - mainly JAVA for start and JS in the
                        project phase (backend & frontend). I would like to continue this journey with my first
                        full-stack developer job with the opportunity to learn the basics of UX.
