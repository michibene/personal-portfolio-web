                            As a landscape architect I am close to design and 3D modeling. This job taught me how to
                            handle multiple tasks and adhere to strict deadlines. I really like to learn new things and
                            I like graphic design.

                            But I've always been curious about how feature-rich web apps work. This curiosity and
                            eagerness resulted in the completion of the junior programmer course - mainly JAVA for start
                            and JS in the project phase (backend & frontend). I would like to continue this journey with
                            my first full-stack developer job with the opportunity to learn the basics of UX.
